# 🧏‍♂️ Text-to-Sign Language Translation System

An AI-powered accessibility project that converts **spoken or written content from videos into Sign Language**, enabling inclusive communication for deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

---

## 📌 Overview

Sign languages have a fundamentally different grammar and structure from spoken languages, making direct translation non-trivial.  
This project bridges that gap by leveraging **Speech Recognition**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Deep Learning** to transform video content into **American Sign Language (ASL)** representations.

The system extracts speech from videos, processes it linguistically, and renders sign language output using either animated avatars or gesture-based visual sequences.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Improve accessibility to digital video content
- Convert spoken language into grammatically correct sign language
- Provide a scalable and modular AI-based solution
- Enable future support for real-time translation and multiple sign languages
